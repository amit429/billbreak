## The Problem

Splitting bills shouldn't require a math degree. Yet every group dinner ends the same way:

- *"Who had the extra drink?"*
- *"Should we just split equally?"* (unfair to the person who only had salad)
- *"Can someone calculate the tax for each person?"*
- *"I only had 2 of the 5 cokes, why am I paying for all of them?"*

**BillBreak solves this.**

## Features

### 📸 AI-Powered Receipt Scanning
Upload a photo of your receipt and let Google's Gemini AI extract all items automatically. No manual typing required.

### 👥 Smart User Management
- Add people with a single tap
- Each person gets a unique color identity (Emerald, Blue, Purple, Rose)
- Visual avatars make tracking assignments intuitive

### ✨ Flexible Item Assignment

**Single Items** — Tap to assign, tap again to split
```
Pizza → Alice (full item)
Pizza → Alice + Bob (split 50/50)
```

**Multi-Quantity Items** — Assign exact amounts
```
5 Coca-Colas (₹60 each):
  → Alice: 3 cokes (₹180)
  → Bob: 1 coke (₹60)  
  → Carol: 1 coke (₹60)
```

### 🎯 Drag & Drop
Intuitively drag items to users for quick assignment. Works on both desktop and mobile.

### 📊 Live Calculations
- Real-time progress bar showing "Bill Covered" percentage
- Animated subtotals update as you assign items
- Tax and tip split proportionally based on each person's share

### 📱 Responsive Design
- **Mobile**: Vertical item list with bottom user dock
- **Desktop**: Split-screen layout (60/40) with sidebar

### 🎨 Modern UI
- Dark theme with glassmorphism effects
- Smooth Framer Motion animations
- Beautiful color-coded user system
